const dogs = [
  { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ['Alice', 'Bob'] },

// 1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
const getRecommendedFood = weight => Math.floor(weight ** 0.75 * 28);

dogs.forEach(function (dog) {
  dog.recommendedFood = getRecommendedFood(dog.weight);
});

// console.log(dogs);

// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose)
